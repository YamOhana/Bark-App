Bark is an application for dogs owners and dogs alike, our clients are first of all, the dogs!

The application is a mixture of both social network and matching apps, which you, the dog owner can match the perfect friends for men's best friend.

By selecting your dogs preferences, features and hobbies, you can filter amongst other dogs to find a friend for your 4 legged friend.

The application was created with React.js for frontend features, and firebase for database and server.
